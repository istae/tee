## Tee Programming Language

Tee is a very simple language meant for learning the inner mechanisms of compilers (eg: lexers, parsers, etc..). 

Currently, here's what can be parsed:

```
x = 3 + 5 * 2 / 1 + 1 * 2
x = x + 2
x = "asd" + 2
x = x < 2

if x < 2 {
	x = 12 + 4
}

y = x * x

for x < 4 {

}

```
